TODO                                                      -*- mode: org; -*-

Note: Main development focus is on the PerlTk interface, at least
      until I find (and learn to use) equivalent Wx controls for the
      screens, with the same functionality as the PerlTk widgets have.

* To do [20%]
  - [ ] Improve exception handling, error reporting and user messages;
  - [ ] Test Log::Dispatch::FileRotate;
  - [X] Implement language support (translations);
  - [ ] Date fields and date validation in TM;
  - [ ] Implement CUBRID support;

* Someday, maybe [0%]
  - [ ] Custom search menu and tool (for queries like records inserted today);
  - [ ] Allow comma as decimal separator;
  - [ ] Admin tool screen to show the connected users;
  - [ ] Paginate records in the List tab (prev 50, next 50);
