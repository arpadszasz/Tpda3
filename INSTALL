Tpda3 is a classic desktop database application framework, written in
Perl.  Has PerlTk and (experimental) wxPerl support for the GUI part
and Firebird and PostgreSQL support for the RDBMS.

Open source, alpha status software, be careful it might harm your
computer ;) Be sure to read the Disclaimer of Warranty. from the GNU
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

'Makefile.PL' lists the required modules, from that list 'DBD::SQLite'
is required for the tests. The other DBD modules are optional but one.
They are listed as 'recommends' in Makefile.PL, but that's because I
didn't know how to make an optional requirement.

WxPerl interface is experimental and far from being complete.

INSTALLATION

% tar -xvzf Tpda3-0.42.tar.gz

or

% unzip  Tpda3-0.42.zip

cd Tpda3-0.42

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

For testing the application without installation, after 'make' one can use:

% perl -Mblib bin/tpda3 [options] ...

Only make install should be run as root.


USAGE

After installing the application, at first start, the configuration
directory is initialized automatically.  The following command will
list all the defined application configurations.

% tpda3 -l

On a fresh installation this command should return:

test-tk
test-wx

Create and/or load SQL schema into the classicmodels SQLite database.

% ./script/load_classicmodels.sh si

Run the demo application with:

% tpda3 test-tk [-u username -p password]

Type something (anything) in the user and password entries.

The SQLite support is partial, you only can make queries, inserting
data needs SQL INSERT ... RETURNING capability in the RDMBS.

I would like some feedback about this application, especially what you
like or what you don't like and why, about it.

Thanks for your interest.

Have fun!
