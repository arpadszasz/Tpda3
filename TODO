TODO                                                      -*- mode: org; -*-

Note: Main development focus is on the PerlTk interface, at least
      until I find (and learn to use) equivalent Wx controls for the
      screens, with the same functionality with the PerlTk widgets.

* To do [20%]
  - [ ] Improve exception handling, error reporting and user messages;

  - [ ] Admin tool screen to show the connected users;
  - [ ] Paginate records in the List tab (prev 50, next 50);
