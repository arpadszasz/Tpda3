Tpda3 (Tiny Perl Database Application 3)

Tpda3 is a classic desktop database application framework, written in
Perl.  Has PerlTk and (experimental) wxPerl support for the GUI part
and Firebird and PostgreSQL support for the RDBMS.


REQUIREMENTS

- RDBMS

Because it's based on the "INSERT ... RETURNING" SQL statement,
requires:

 Postgres version 8.2 or greater or
 Firebird version 2.1 or greater

Also it has limited SQLite support (used only for testing). Inserting
records doesn't work.

- Operating System

Tpda3 should work on any OS where Perl and the required dependencies
can be installed, but currently it's only tested on GNU/Linux and
Windows XP.  Feedback for how it works or not on other OSs is welcome.

Tpda3 is the successor of TPDA and, hopefully, has a much better API
implementation, Tpda3 aims to follow the Model View Controller (MVC)
architecture pattern.  The look and the user interface functionality
of Tpda3 is almost the same as of TPDA, with some minor improvements.

The configuration files formats are new and are in YAML (YAML::Tiny)
and Apache format (Config::General).


TROUBLESHOOTING

See README.patches. There is a new dir on SF with some patched modules.
