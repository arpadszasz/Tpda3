Tpda3 is a classic desktop database application framework, written in
Perl.  Has PerlTk and (experimental) wxPerl support for the GUI part
and Firebird and PostgreSQL support for the RDBMS.

Also has some very limited SQLite support currently used only for testing.

Tpda3 aims to follow the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture
pattern.

Tpda3 is the successor of TPDA and, hopefully, has a much better API
implementation.  The look and the user interface functionality of
Tpda3 is almost the same as of TPDA, with some minor improvements.

The configuration files formats are new and are in YAML (YAML::Tiny)
and Apache format (Config::General).
