CHANGES

Tpda3 is the new TPDA.  Tpda3 aims to follow the Model View Controller
(MVC) architecture and will completely replace Tpda when all the
features that Tpda has will be implemented.

Other changes:

Thanks to the File::UserConfig module, the configurations files are
automatically installed in the user's HOME directory, at test faze, or
at the first start of the application.

The XML configuration files used by the old Tpda are replaced by
multiple files in "YAML" format (handled by the YAML::Tiny module) and
a file in "Config" format (handled by the Config::General module).

Tpda3 has from early stage a few tests, for the configuration module
and for the database connection.  The GUI tests are not doing their
job yet, they tend to pass even when the screen modules throw errors,
and warnings, but they look cool. ;)

In order to have minimum parameter passing between instances, the
configuration module "Tpda3::Config" is using the "Class::Singleton"
module and the "Class::Accessor" module for automatically create
accessors for the main configuration elements.  The database
connection module "Tpda3::Db" is also using the Class::Singleton
module.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The implementation of the MVC pattern is (heavily) based on the
implementation from the Cipres project:

CONTRIBUTING

I'm in a continuous process of learning Perl, a very challenging
process, I can say, certainly one of the attributes that makes Perl my
preferred choice of the programming language to use.  That is why if
one thinks that I don't use properly the modules and/or follow the
patterns for implementing MVC and has the patience to explain why and
how it thinks is better in his way, please let me know.  Thank you.
