Tpda3 is a classic desktop database application framework, written in
Perl.  Has PerlTk and (experimental) wxPerl support for the GUI part
and Firebird and PostgreSQL support for the RDBMS.

Open source, alpha status software, be careful it might harm your
computer ;) Be sure to read the Disclaimer of Warranty. from the GNU
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

'Makefile.PL' lists the required modules, from that list 'DBD::SQLite'
is required for the tests. The other DBD modules are optional but one.
They are listed as 'recommends' in Makefile.PL, but that's because I
didn't know how to make an optional requirement.

WxPerl interface is experimental and far from being complete.

INSTALLATION (for GNU/Linux and other *nix like OS)

(Sorry, but because of the almost nonexistent feedback in the past I
will focus only on GNU/Linux support in the docs and helper tools, but
the application works well in Windows and should work in other OSs too).

% tar -xvzf Tpda3-0.NN.tar.gz

or

% tar xvzf Tpda3-0.nn.tar.gz

cd Tpda3-0.nn

Create and load SQL schema into the classicmodels SQLite test database.

% sh script/load_classicmodels.sh si

Then as usual for a Perl application:

% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

For testing the application without installation, after 'make' one can use:

% perl -Mblib bin/tpda3 [options] ...

Only make install should be run as root.


USAGE

After installing the application, at first start, the configuration
directory is initialized automatically.  The following command will
list all the defined application configurations.

% tpda3 -l

On a fresh installation this command should return:

test-tk
test-wx

Run the demo application with:

% tpda3 test-tk

The SQLite support is partial, you only can make queries, inserting
data needs SQL INSERT ... RETURNING capability in the RDMBS.
