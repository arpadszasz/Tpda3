TODO                                                      -*- mode: org; -*-

Note: Main development focus is on the PerlTk interface, at least
      until I find (and learn to use) equivalent Wx controls for the
      screens, with the same functionality as the PerlTk widgets have.

* To do [16%]
  - [ ] Improve exception handling, error reporting and user messages;
